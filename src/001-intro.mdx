# Hello there, General Storybook.

## MDX

Hi!

This is storybook. You are currently looking at a rendered version of *MDX*, which is
a hybrid of Markdown and JSX (React) to write interactive documentation.

Use the navbar on the left to progress through this workshop!

*Tip*: open `src/001-intro.mdx` to see the source of this documentation.

## What is Storybook?

It's an isolated environment for developing and documenting UI components, typically
used in React projects.

* Develop, test and document components in isolation
* Interactive - see how components react to state/prop changes
* Quick visual feedback and potential for automated visual regression testing
* Accessibility testing is a first-class citizen
* Single source of truth and enables collaboration

## Examples

* [OF: SDK](https://open-formulieren.github.io/open-forms-sdk/)
* [OF: renderer](https://open-formulieren.github.io/formio-renderer/)
* [NLDS: Utrecht](https://nl-design-system.github.io/utrecht/storybook/)
* [Maykin UI](https://main--659d1ab1b20571e0dbb5e47c.chromatic.com/)

## Context

* Primarily applied to React projects/frontends, since we use mostly React.
* There are options with Django templates, but they're... not elegant
