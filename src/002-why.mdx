# Why use Storybook?

## Isolation

* Developing components in isolation helps enforce loose coupling / composition
* Iterate/develop on (incomplete) features quickly without breaking `main`

    - Develop/compose components in their intended use case
    - Hook everything up to your main app when you're ready

* No need to click through cumbersome interactions over and over again to test a small
  thing

## Accessibility

* Plugins can do automated accessibility checking/auditing
* Interaction tests: uses testing-library under the hood, which favours accessible queries
* Ready to use addons for colour blindness simulation, viewports, light/dark mode...

## Sharing

* Static HTML/JS/CSS build -> easy to deploy on github pages
* With Chromatic: automated build for each pull request: quickly test the changes when
  reviewing a PR without needing to check out everything locally
* Demo/checking with developers by looking at just the stories with only the necessary
  context
* (Publicly) deploy your storybook for easy-to-find (and host) documentation, reference,
  exchange ideas
* Get user feedback from testers interacting with stories

## Automated (visual) testing

* Chromatic makes snapshots of each story & compares before + after for each PR.
  [Example](https://www.chromatic.com/build?appId=634043ae879dc17405b0e567&number=1764)
* Interaction tests are executed by Chromatic
* or run interaction tests in Github actions CI pipeline

## Documentation - component library / intended usage

* MDX: ease of use of Markdown + expressiveness/interaction of JSX/React
* Documentation co-located with the code/component
* Easy to document intended uses, backing research... (example: date field in OF SDK)
* Autodocs feature, combined with Typescript & JS docblocks is very powerful (almost
  similar to Sphinx autodoc)

## Developer experience

* Automation
* Rich ecosystem of addons (plugins):

    - react-intl for i18n
    - MSW for API mocking
    - react-router (SPA routing library)
    - playwright-based tests (experimental)

* Auto-reload: very fast feedback loop

## Drawbacks

* Steep learning curve
* Lots of dependencies
* More complicated build toolchain/pipeline
* Test flakiness is a thing sometimes :(
* JS ecosystem is still fast moving
* SB maintainers like major versions (= breaking changes)
