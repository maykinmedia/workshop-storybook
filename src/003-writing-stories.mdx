# Writing stories

A story is a single state/snapshot/configuration of a component, defined in Storybook.

Users can interact with it (if it's interactive), or change controls in Storybook to
change the state/representation.

## Story files

Storybook discovers stories based on file name: `{someName}.stories.{ext}`. We'll be using
typescript, so the extension will be `ts` or `tsx`. As long as the file is in the `src`
directory, it will be discovered.

**Open `src/003-writing-stories/index.stories.tsx` and check the contents.**

## Story file content: meta

Each story file needs some meta-information to know where it will be available in the
navbar. Additionally, a number of defaults can be provided to help with automated
documentation etc. More elaborate stuff about this in "Args, parameters and decorators"!

For now, the minimum we need is a title:

```tsx
import type {Meta} from '@storybook/react';

interface Args {}

export default {
    title: 'Writing stories',
} satisfies Meta<Args>;
```

The `default` export is used as meta for the stories.

## Story file content: stories

And second, the stories are what we are interested in the most - they show our UI components.

Each named export is considered a story and will  be picked up by storybook. It
automatically creates the name from the export and you usually have to specify very little:

```tsx
import type {StoryObj} from '@storybook/react';

interface Args {}

type Story = StoryObj<Args>;

export const RenderFunction: Story = {
    render: () => <>I am a render function!</>,
}
```

## Args and render function

`args` in Storybook are (some of) the variables that control what is displayed. Don't
worry - it will become more clear. We use Typescript, so we can describe which variables
are supported.

A story needs to be rendered. There are many automatic things for this, but for now we
start with a `render` function. Storybook will call the `render` function, and any
`args` defined will be passed to it. The example above is not interactive at all and
defines just a simple fixed render function. Because we use the React framework, it must
return React components to render.

In the component meta, you can specify default args that apply to all stories. On a
per-story basis you can override these. By default, Storybook creates "controls" for
each `arg`.

## Rendering stories: tasks

**Ah yes. The doing. Of the thing.**

### 1. Finish the `Render Function With Args` story

1. Inspect the story
2. Inspect what `args` looks like
3. Update the render function so that the `name` is displayed
4. Interact with the controls

### 2. Finish the `RenderGreeting` story

There is a `Greeting` component defined, which you can render with:

```tsx
<Greeting fullName="Pomme de Terre" />
````

1. Update the `RenderGreeting` story to render the Greeting component.
2. Make sure the `name` arg is passed down to the component.
3. Interact with the name control and see how the greeting changes.

## Reducing boilerplate - specifying `component`

Specifying a render function every time is repetitive, especially considering all stories
in a file *should* be about the same component.

A `render` function is the exception rather than the norm - it can be useful if you need
special wrapping or careful control of args, but often there are better solutions (see
parameters and decorators later).

Storybook is aware of React components - and in particular the `props` a component takes.
By default, a render function is generated from the `component` and any `args` are passed
down to the component as `props`. Typescript helps here with autocomplete and checking
that you do the correct thing.

## Component stories: tasks

### 1. Finish the setup in `02-component.stories.tsx`

1. Open the file
2. Uncomment the `component` definition
3. Check the rendered story
4. Uncomment the `fullName` arg in the meta
5. Check the rendered story
6. Interact with the controls
7. Try defining a different value for the arg at the story level

### 2. Extend the component and story

1. Open `Greeting.tsx`
2. Add an additional prop (you can think of something!)
3. Add a new story and provide an `arg` for this new prop

Bonus points for picking a prop that is *not* a string!
