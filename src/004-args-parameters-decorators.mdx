# Args and other concepts

While `args` are directly passed to the story render function, there are more
concepts involved in rendering a story:

* `argTypes`
* `decorators`
* `parameters`

Some of these are bundled/provided in the "story context" to other functionalities
in storybook, or they work well together.

## `argTypes`

`argTypes` typically influence two common aspects of stories:

* the controls table
* the args table rendered in documentation

You typically use them to polish what storybook exposes/documents if the automatically
inferred information from the component is not detailed enough or not very practical.
