# Args and other concepts

While `args` are directly passed to the story render function, there are more
concepts involved in rendering a story:

* `argTypes`
* `decorators`
* `parameters`

Some of these are bundled/provided in the "story context" to other functionalities
in storybook, or they work well together.

## `argTypes`

`argTypes` typically influence two common aspects of stories:

* the controls table
* the args table rendered in documentation

You typically use them to polish what storybook exposes/documents if the automatically
inferred information from the component is not detailed enough or not very practical.

### Tasks: `argTypes`

#### 1. Inspect the controls and docs

1. Inspect the controls for the stories - pay attention to the `title` and `children`
   props.
2. Check the `Card` component type definitions of `title` and `children`.
3. Can you explain what SB does for the controls?
4. Check the docs page - focus on the controls table below the default story.

#### 2. Tweak controls

1. Open `01-argTypes.stories.tsx`
2. Play around with the commented `argTypes` and check their effect.
3. Check `Card.mdx` and the "Manual docs" to see the `argTypes` effects.

See the [Storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/controls) for more
advanced use cases.

## `decorators`

Decorators are the same concept as they are in plain Javascript or Python code - they
wrap the thing they decorate and modify the behaviour in some way.

In storybook, decorators wrap around the story - you can use them to provide more
representative context while still primarily documenting the component/story in
isolation.

Common uses are:

* Setting up some necessary React context (provider) (e.g. react-intl, Formik, theme...)
* Wrapping the component in its (expected) modal container

Decorators receive the `Story` as argument, and the story context, containing the `args`,
`parameters`... amongst others, for example:

```tsx
const withSomeDecorator = (Story, {args}) => (
    <div style={{backgroundColor: args.backgroundColor}}>
        <Story />
    </div>
);
```

If you specify a story arg `backgroundColor`, then it will be applied to the wrapper div.

### Tasks: `decorators`

#### 1. Implement a decorator that renders stories in a card

For this, we can re-use our `Greeting` and `Card` components. The code is in
`02-decorators.stories.tsx`. The stories are `Greeting` component stories.

1. Open the stories file
2. Finish the implementation of `withCard`

    * For now, consider a hardcoded title
    * You can also decide on a fixed appearance. Tip: `modifiers` prop!
3. Check the controls

#### 2. Make it fancy: add args for the card

It would be cool if you can be interactive even on the card to play around with things.
Let's make the card title and appearance controllable in storybook.

1. Use the `FancyDecorator` story and the `fancyWithCard` decorator
2. Finish the implementation

    * Make it possible to pass an extra `arg` with the name `cardTitle` that becomes the
      card title. Ensure you can change the value in the Storybook UI.
    * Translate the `isPadded` and `hasShadow` args into their Card-component-specific
       meaning
    * It's recommended to leverage the `Args` interface here for type safety!
