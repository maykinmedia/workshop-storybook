# Interaction testing

Storybook has `play` functions, which use [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/)
under the hood. You can simulate realistic user interactions with this.

Compared to Jest/Vitest (unit) tests:

* runs in a real browser
* easier debugging because you can inspect the state
* Panel in SB UI displays the steps and allows you to go back/forward
* drawback: weird edge cases with auto-reload and focus state

An interaction test typically looks like:

```tsx
const MyStory: {
    play: async ({canvasElement, ...context}) => {
        const canvas = within(canvasElement);

        const button = await canvas.findByRole('button', {name: 'Confirm'});
        expect(button).toBeVisible();

        await userEvent.click(button);
        expect(await canvas.findByRole('link', {name: 'A dynamically displayed link'})).toBeVisible();
    };
}
```

* Accessible "queries" (`*ByRole`) ensure that accessibility is a first class feature
* Abstractions for user interactions
* Assertions via `expect` with knowledge about the DOM
* Easy mocks/spies

## Tasks

### 1. Submit the form

1. Open `Form.stories.ts` and locate the `SubmitForm` story
2. Implement the interaction test to click the submit button
3. Check the "Interactions" panel in the Storybook UI
4. Inspect the "Actins" panel in the Storybook UI

### 2. Improve test assertions

1. Continue in the same story
2. Check the `onSubmit` arg
3. Add an assertion that the `onSubmit` handler was called with the entered form values

    * Tip: `expect(...).toHaveBeenCalledWith`
    * Tip: the `play` function recceives _story context_


### 3. Interact with form inputs

1. Locate the `TypeInInputs` story
2. Interact with the `name` input from the test

    * Change the input value
    * Assert that the input value is reflected in the preview

3. Interact with the amount input from the test

    * Change the amount of items
    * Assert on the effect of changing the number
